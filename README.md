Certainly! I assume you're aiming for a more complete demonstration of a rollup process. Below is a brief description of a rollup system followed by an example that mimics a simplified rollup process:

**Rollup Description**:
Rollups are a layer 2 scaling solution that helps to increase the throughput of a blockchain by processing transactions off-chain and then committing a summary to the main chain. This reduces the amount of data stored on the main chain. There are two primary types of rollups: zk-rollups and optimistic rollups. Both use different mechanisms to validate the correctness of off-chain transactions, but the underlying idea is the same.

A simple rollup system typically involves:

1. **Users**: Send transactions to a rollup aggregator.
2. **Aggregator(client.rs)**: Collects multiple transactions, processes them off-chain, and then creates a rollup (summary) which is committed to the main chain.
3. **Validators(server.rs)**: Ensure that the rollup is correct (this varies based on the type of rollup, e.g., zk proofs for zk-rollups and fraud proofs for optimistic rollups).

**Simplified Rollup Console Example**:

```bash
$ cargo run aggregator
   Compiling rollup_task v0.1.0 (/Users/pankajrathore/Desktop/Github/polygon_rollup_test/rollup_task)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.65s
     Running `target/debug/rollup_task aggregator`
Starting rollup aggregator...

$ cargo run client
   Compiling rollup_task v0.1.0 (/Users/pankajrathore/Desktop/Github/polygon_rollup_test/rollup_task)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.64s
     Running `target/debug/rollup_task client`
Sending transaction to aggregator...
Transaction hash: 0x12345abcde

$ cargo run client
   Running `target/debug/rollup_task client`
Sending another transaction to aggregator...
Transaction hash: 0x67890fghij

$ cargo run aggregator
Collecting transactions...
Creating rollup...
Rollup hash: 0xabcdef98765
Sending rollup to main chain...

$ cargo run main_chain
   Running `target/debug/rollup_task main_chain`
Received rollup. Validating...
Rollup is valid. Committing to main chain.
```

This example showcases:

1. An aggregator collecting transactions.
2. Users (clients) sending transactions to the aggregator.
3. The aggregator creating a rollup and sending it to the main chain.
4. The main chain receiving and validating the rollup.

Note: This is a highly simplified representation, and a real-world rollup would involve cryptographic proofs, validation mechanisms, and more complexity in terms of transaction structure and processing.
